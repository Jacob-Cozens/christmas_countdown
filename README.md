# Christmas Countdown!

### Overview

This is a small side project I worked on for a challenge given to us at TripleTen. For the holiday season, what better than to make a website that counts down to Christmas day! This website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a fully functional clock that counts down to Christmas day, as well as some buttons that redirect to my GitHub page (Hey, that's here!), and a button that helps to _set the mood_.

**Project Features**

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- BEM Methodology
- JavaScript

Using what I've recently learned in Javascript, I made interactive buttons to make the website more engaging!
